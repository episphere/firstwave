        COVID<sup>19</sup>
        first wave
    </h1>
    <h2>
    The epidemiology dynamics of COVID-19 have changed markedly with the adoption of large scale isolation. 
    Improvement of therapeutic approaches, more granular confinment and social distancing policies, are changing both the mortality and infection progression profiles of new cases.
    The complexity of the process is highligthed by the effect on additional mortality by other causes than COVID, such as Heart Disease and Altzheimer.
    In the United States, the new dynamics identify a discontinuity at the end of June we will use here to mark the end of a <i>first wave</i>. 
    The interactive representation of the non-linear dynamics of this 4 month long <i>first wave</i> are the main topic of this report.
    Specifically, the time-delayed embedding and compression of the multivariate timeseries is performed by a neural network visualization designed to explore relationships between causes of mortality.
    In addition, this comparison of 2020 data with the previous 5 years for this initial period seeks to provide a baseline for the shifting dynamics of COVID-19 progression.
