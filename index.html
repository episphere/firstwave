        COVID<sup>19</sup> First Wave Mortality Dynamics
    </h1>
    <h2>
    The first 4 months of COVID-19 pandemic in the US are characterized by mortality, caused directly by SARS-2 infection as well as by other casues, that change as social isolation policies are adopted.

    <h2>Abstract</h2>
    <p>The epidemiology dynamics of COVID-19 have changed markedly with the adoption of large scale isolation. 
    Improvement of therapeutic approaches, more granular confinment practices and social distancing policies, are changing both the mortality and infection progression profiles of new cases.
    The complexity of the process is highligthed by the effect on additional mortality by causes other than COVID, such as Heart Disease and Altzheimer.
    In the United States, the new dynamics identify a discontinuity at the end of June we will use here to mark the end of a <i>first wave</i>. 
    The interactive representation of the non-linear dynamics of this 4 month period are the main topic of this report.
    Specifically, the time-delayed embedding and compression of the multivariate timeseries is performed by a neural network visualization designed to explore relationships between causes of mortality.
    It is also hoped that the comparison of 2020 data with the previous 5 years for this initial period provides a baseline and a methodology to explore the shifting dynamics of COVID-19 progression in subsequent months and years.
